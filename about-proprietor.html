  <p>
    Over 32 years in hospitality, I’ve grown from a Team Leader at Hyatt Regency Delhi to CEO with The Five Managers, Indore, gaining cross-functional experience in hotel operations, pre-openings, project coordination’s and leading projects towards operations. Key milestones include leading multiple pre-openings, senior roles at top brands like Sarovar, IHG, ITC, Radisson and managing resorts and catering projects. From operations to leadership, each step has shaped me into a dynamic, adaptable professional ready for future challenges.
  </p>

  <h3>Evolving into a Comprehensive Hospitality Consulting: A Journey from Operations to Strategic Execution</h3>
  <p>
    Over the past few years, I have undergone a significant professional transformation—from being a seasoned hospitality operator to establishing myself as a strategic hospitality Consulting. This evolution was not sudden; it was shaped by over three decades of experience across the hospitality spectrum, including hands-on leadership roles, project development, pre-opening responsibilities, and continuous improvement initiatives. With each milestone, I acquired insights that have culminated in my ability to now offer integrated, turnkey hospitality consulting services that guide a project from its inception to launch.
  </p>

  <h3>The Shift from Operations to Strategic Consulting</h3>
  <p>
    With a foundation in operations and cross-departmental leadership, I now offer end-to-end hospitality consulting—from design execution to ROI forecasting—delivering turnkey solutions with strategic, hands-on expertise.
  </p>

  <h3>Delivering Turnkey Solutions – From Vision to Reality</h3>
  <p>
   My consulting services focus on delivering turnkey solutions— executing projects from concept to launch, including civil, MEP, interiors, and preopening setup—ensuring seamless execution, brand compliance, and efficiency under one coordinated umbrella.
  </p>

  <h3>ROI Forecasting – Building on a Foundation of Financial Strategy</h3>
  <p>
    One of my key strengths lies in ROI forecasting and financial viability analysis, using real-world experience and provide data-driven, financially sound projections that align design, location, and service models with investor goals.
  </p>

  <h3>Hands-On Execution – Bridging Design and Functionality</h3>
  <p>
    What sets me apart is my hands-on involvement. I bridge design and operations, ensuring layouts support service flow, guest comfort, and efficiency—aligning architectural vision with functional needs for sustainable, profitable, and guest-centric hospitality spaces.
  </p>

  <h3>Departmental Setup – Creating Operational Readiness</h3>
  <p>
    I set up fully equipped departments—BOH, Engineering, F&B, Housekeeping, Front Office, Admin—ensuring smooth, full-capacity operations from day one.
  </p>

  <h3>Cost-Efficiency Without Compromising Quality</h3>
  <p>
    I balance quality with cost-efficiency, ensuring every rupee delivers long-term value through smart vendor choices, durable designs, and ROI-driven decisions without compromising service standards.
  </p>

  <h3>Experience-Driven Consulting – From CEO to Ground Reality</h3>
  <p>
    My shift into consulting is underpinned by my earlier experience as a CEO, project head, and operator. I’ve not only run properties—I’ve launched them, leased them, turned them around, and managed them at scale. Whether it was developing resort properties, managing catering operations delivering thousands of meals a day, or working with internationally recognized hotel brands, each experience has contributed to a nuanced understanding of what makes a hospitality venture succeed.
